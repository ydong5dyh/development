    <div class="intro">
      <p>For this project, I chose the theme of buying boba milk tea online and design a list interface using React. It displays a list of items you can buy from a boba store and it allows you to
        filter by certain criterias or sort by price. You can add your favorite boba to the cart and it would also calculate the total price for you.

    <h1 class="goal">Application Goal</h1>

    <div class="goalcontent">
    <p>The goal of this application is to facilitate the process of buying products from a boba store online. A typical boba store features many tea type, including black tea and green tea, and it
    sometimes offer other products including fruit tea of desserts. If we display all the items in a single page, the customers may need a lot of time to find their favorite product. So I designed two
    filters, one for product type and another for tea type, so that customers can easily narrow down to a few options that they can choose from. I also implemented a sort feature of the price, which
    can be quite useful when the customers have a budget or when they are not sure about the types.</p>
    <p> In addition, I also implemented a shopping cart to better mimic the online shopping experience. You can add whatever product to the cart, and it would keep track of all items and also calculate
    the total price for you.</p>

    <h1 class="usability">Usability Principles</h1>
    <div class="usabilitycontent">
    <p>During the design process, there are a few principles that I considered.
    <ul>
      <li>I put two filters and one sorting feature at the top since the users may notice it first and it would stay at the same position
        no matter what filters users apply.</li>
      <li>I designed the filter to be several buttons since they are concrete classes of products, but for the sorting I used a dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>For every product, I put the image to the left and the description next to it. I used a slightly darker color for the entire space of each product so that users would not confuse between products.</li>
      <li>Lastly, for the shopping cart, I used a different background color to distinguish between product list, but I put it right next to the product list so that users can view items from both lists at the same time.</li>
    </ul>
