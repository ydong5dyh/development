    <div class="intro">
      <p>For our project, we chose to prototype a startup called Clover. Clover is essentially a text editor, similar to popular editors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. One main differentiating feature that
        Clover emphasizes is the ability to edit documents in “infinite canvas” mode, as opposed to a restricted page editor. Clover also aims to integrate file sharing, syncing with a calendar, and allowing drawing
        tools. For our prototype, we attempted to best capture these main features.

      <p>We found that each of our sketches, while conveying our general ideas on the full site, honed in on a specific (and different) feature of the app. One of us had a heavy focus on the home page, one on the calendar feature,
        one on the editor itself, and one on the zooming feature of Canvas mode. Thus, we decided to combine these functionalities together, adding to our product the feature we each focused on while also creating a unifying theme
         for our app. We worked together on the means of navigating through the app, so that we could create lo-fi wireframes of the app and translate them seamlessly into high-fidelity prototypes.
       <br>Here are a few screenshots of our low-fi wireframes.</p>
